For a more full-fledged example, try running: `python rivescript brain`
This will run the built-in Interactive Mode of the RiveScript library. It has
some more advanced features like supporting JSON for communication with the
bot. See `python rivescript --help` for more info.

example.py is just a simple script that loads the RiveScript documents from
the 'brain/' folder, and lets you chat with the bot.

Type /quit when you're done to exit this example.
